                     sorting by overperforming.
        count : ( positive int or -1, default 10 ) The number of posts to return. -1 means to return all available.
                    If requesting more than 100 posts, batchSize must be set.
        includeHistory : (None or True, default None (does not include)) Includes timestep data for growth of each post

                    type does not mean all videos, it refers to videos that aren't native_video, youtube or vine (e.g.
                    a video on Vimeo).
        weightAngry : ( 0-10, default 0 ) How much weight to give to each type of interaction. If you send in no weights, all
                    weights will use the current dashboard defaults. If you send in at least one weight, all other
                    weights will default to 0. Weights are multiplied by interaction counts: e.g. weightsComment at 1
                    and all others at 0 will find the most commented-on posts. weightLike at 1 and weightShare at 2 will
                    give shares twice the impact as likes when computing scores.
